# Chat Republic
Chat Republic was a video game publisher founded in 2006 by CEO Andreas von Koskull & CTO Juha Lainema. The company was headquartered in Helsinki, Finland.
The company specialized in creating online social racing games such as Superstar Streetz and most notably Superstar Racing.

Although the company made a promising entry into the online MMO sphere, overreliance on its freemium business model & decline in player numbers
eventually led to the company going out of business and into liquidation.

After the company's closure, both Superstar Racing & Superstar Streetz have since been controlled by Gunther Gerben-Boxhammer.
As of January 2023, both games have been taken off the Steam page, and the servers were effectively shut down.
